                    <p>Nellies Bar is a nice pub to work in. ive been working there for over a year  and I have to admit, I enjoy working for them. I was given the chance to work with people and meet people I'll never forget. Some of them are now my closest friends.</p>
						
					<p>My job was to serve drink to the customers and assist other employees when needed when busy. I enjoy working there and its extremely handy to still get hours there at the weekend when i come home from college.</p>

					<p>I worked in Dunnes Stores for the weeks coming up to Christmas. It was extremely busy and it really gave me an insight into how large retail outlets operate.
					<p>I worked on the tils and I had a lot of interaction with customers. It really honed my customer service skills and it was very beneficial to me.
					<p>I also worked on the shop floor and have experience with correct procedures and regulations with lifting heavy items.</p>
